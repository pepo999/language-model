indeed the life and savings the bhagavan have given death blow the sectarian bigotry and fanaticism the called religious world. whosoever has read his sayings impressed with the universality his spiritual ideals which embraced the ideals all mankind. from his childhood sri ramakrishna fought against all sectarian doctrines and dogmas, but yet the same time showed that all sects and creeds were but the paths which lead sincere and earnest souls the one universal goal all religions. having realized the highest ideal every religion following the methods and practices the various sects and

whosoever has heard his most wonderful life has felt his soul that ramakrishna was the perfect ideal mankind. made his appearance obscure part bengal where passed his early boyhood, but his youth and maturity were spent near calcutta, the capital british india, cosmopolitan city london, new york, any other large city the civilized world and the seat education, refinement and scientific knowledge. allowed the sceptical minds the students and professors colleges and universities well educated men and women the world come direct touch with the self effulgent light divine wisdom which was shining its full glory through his childlike, soft, and tender form. scholars and intelligent people all classes poured from every quarter that spot which was sanctified the presence the bhagavan. was the living example the spiritual greatness and divinity which had been manifested the great incarnations like christ, buddha, krishna, rama, chaitanya and other saviours the world. know number sceptics and agnostics who had never believed christ buddha krishna divine incarnations, who had never accepted the authority the scriptures, but the contrary had maintained that the lives christ and other saviours were but exaggerated accounts based upon the imagination their disciples, anxious deify their human masters such sceptics and unbelievers when they met ramakrishna and watched his superhuman life, were convinced that the lives christ, buddha, krishna, and other avataras must have been true and real. the same sceptics, when they beheld his divine powers, were deeply impressed with his personality that they prostrated before him, kissed the dust his holy feet and realized that was the personification the sermon the mount, the incarnation divinity earth, and the remanifestation christ, buddha, krishna, and chaitanya one form. all the special qualities and divine powers that had adorned the wonderful character each these great personages were witnessed them this uncommon divine manifestation the nineteenth century. have not watched with admiration when the followers all the great religions the world recognized sri ramakrishna their divine ideals? have not seen how quakers and orthodox christians knelt and prayed before him and worshipped him the christ when the bhagavan went into superconscious communion with the heavenly father after hearing the holy name jesus nazareth? the mahometan saints who came see him, prostrated his holy feet and recognized him the highest ideal islam. the buddhists regarded him sambuddha, the enlightened. the followers chaitanya, like vaishnava charan, and others, worshipped him the second prophet nuddea when bhagavan sri ramakrishna occupied the altar which was reverentially dedicated sri chaitanya hundreds devoted vaishnavas, who always prostrated before that altar and prayed their lord guaranga. the worshippers krishna called him the incarnation krishna. the devotees the divine mother realized that the mother the universe was playing through him the followers shiva declared that bhagavan sri ramakrishna was their living deity while the sikhs, the faithful votaries guru nanaka, regarded him their holy master. his followers, seeing all these powers, marvelled his greatness and believed that his many sided personality was the living example and the consummation all the previous avataras and divine manifestations. and the truth this was again and again verified and confirmed his acts well his own words who was krishna, rama, christ, buddha, chaitanya has now become ramakrishna. bhagavan was always conscious this truth and spoke before the world well before his dearest disciples. his divine personality was many sided yet one, was his great mission. was show the underlying unity the variety religions and establish that universal religion which sectarian religions are each but partial expressions. like all other saviours the life the bhagavan exemplified his mission. spent the best part his life practising full the different methods yoga. went through every minute detail the devotional exercises and different forms worship ordained the scriptures different nations and practised the followers the various sects and creeds the world. his object devoting much time these practices was find out whether they had any real value the path which leads perfection. ramakrishna's mind was always open truth. would not accept anything second hand authority. would not believe anything because was written book because was declared some great personage. must know the truth first hand. before accepting any statement, must realize his own life and then would speak his personal experience others order that they might gain benefit from it. for nearly twelve years before appeared public made any disciples sri ramakrishna, like scientific investigator, inquired into the beliefs the various sects every religion, followed their methods and performed their rituals and ceremonies with perfect faith and earnest devotion that might realize the goal which could reached each them. his great surprise, however, discovered that arrived god consciousness through each sectarian method. whenever, furthermore, desired follow any particular path, there came him perfected soul each sect who had realized the ideal, direct him that path. everyone these great saints recognized sri ramakrishna the manifestation divine powers, when short time attained that which they had not been able acquire during years austerity, worship and extreme devotion. having finished his investigations, was ready proclaim his message and give the world the fruits his own experience and realization. but unlike other spiritual teachers, did not out search after his disciples and followers. fragrant flower does not hunt for bees but waits patiently for the bees come, the full blown flower spirituality the form sri ramakrishna waited for his disciples come him the temple garden dakshineswara the bank the ganges. when ramakrishna had attained the highest ideal each yoga and had realized the spiritual oneness with the absolute brahman and the mother the universe, rumor spread from mouth mouth that ramakrishna had reached perfection this life. people from all quarters began crowd around him. pandits and scholars every nationality well hundreds devout men and women all sects came see him and listen his original and wonderful teachings. this was the beginning his public life spiritual leader and guide, which continued for nearly sixteen years. during this period did nothing but help mankind freely distributing the priceless jewels spiritual truths which had earned through such struggle, hardship and austerities. ramakrishna had marvellous intellect and keen insight into the true nature things and events, and using the commonest occurrences every day life illustrations, succeeded making the dull minds worldly people grasp the spiritual depth, beauty and grandeur his sublime ideals. poured new life into every word that uttered touch the soul his hearers. people listened with wonder and admiration his original discourses the most difficult problems concerning life and death, the nature and origin the soul, the origin the universe and our relation god. this age scientific rationalism bhagavan sri ramakrishna has shown the world how the lord the universe can realized and attained this life, and one except him has ventured through all the tests sceptics and agnostics prove that had attained god consciousness. those who have seen him, lived with him for years and watched him day and night, have proclaimed before the world that was the embodiment the highest spiritual ideals all nations, and that whoever worships him with faith and reverence worships the latest manifestation divinity. the bhagavan proved his example that wherever there extreme longing see god, there the nearness the realization the absolute truth. his life has given the world grand demonstration that even this age divinity can reached and divine perfection can acquired one who pure, chaste, simple and whose devotion whole hearted and whole souled. have neither seen nor heard character purer, simpler, more chaste, more truthful and more godly than that this ideal mahatman. was like the personification purity and chastity and the embodiment truthfulness. his life was the life absolute renunciation. earthly pleasures and comforts meant nothing him. the only pleasure, comfort happiness which cared for was the blissful state samadhi god consciousness, when his soul, liberated from the bondage body and mind, soared high the infinite space the absolute. this samadhi was natural state with ramakrishna. never had make special effort attain it. often heard him say that when was four years old went into samadhi the sight the beautiful coloring tropical cloud. this realization always remembered and often described his conversation. and grew older his samadhi ecstasy became stronger and deeper. his samadhi his body would become absolutely motionless, his pulse and heart beat imperceptible, his eyes would half open and anyone pressed his eyeball with the finger, his body would not move show the least sign sensation. would remain this state sometimes for few minutes, sometimes for half hour hour, and one occasion continued for three days and nights. then would come down the plane sense consciousness and relate his experiences. had the power separate himself from the cage the physical organism and into this state divine communion his will and stay there long wished. frequently told that reached such height samadhi that had been like ordinary mortal could never have returned his body that mortal had ever come back from that kind samadhi and that the divine mother gave him this power return this plane simply help mankind and establish his mission. him god was father, mother, brother, sister, and everything. recognized earthly relations. never coveted wealth, nor had any earthly possession. realized that gold had more value than earth and became absolutely unattached riches, understanding the transitoriness the objects which can acquired wealth. often said that immortality could not purchased money, and emphasized his example the true meaning the vedic passage neither meritorious deed, nor progeny, nor wealth, but renunciation alone the immortal truth can acquired. renunciation the attachment worldly things the gate god consciousness. christ, buddha, chaitanya, sankaracharya and all other saviours and spiritual leaders the world exemplified this living the life absolute renunciation. very rare find this age perfect ideal the renunciation lust and worldly attachment. bhagavan sri ramakrishna practised the ideal the renunciation riches such extent that was able make his body respond involuntarily the touch coin shrinking from even sound sleep. have often seen him suffer pain when was obliged touch coin any metal. who could more perfect ideal renunciation this age materialism! sri ramakrishna taught that every woman, old young, was the representative the divine mother. worshipped god the mother the universe and frequently declared that his divine mother had shown him that all women represent divine motherhood earth. for the first time the religious history the world was this ideal preached any divine incarnation. and upon this depends the salvation men and especially women all countries from immorality, corruption and such other vices prevail civilized community. his living example the bhagavan established the truth spiritual marriage the soul plane even this age sensuality. had wife whom always treated with reverence and whom regarded the manifestation his divine mother. never had any sex relation with her with any woman the physical plane. his wife, the blessed virgin sarada devi, still living like embodiment holy motherhood with innumerable spiritual children around her. she turn has always regarded the bhagavan her blessed mother divine human form. the last moment his earthly career the bhagavan was absolutely pure, chaste, and perfect child his divine mother the universe. furthermore, ramakrishna uplifted the ideal womanhood the spiritual plane accepting his first guru spiritual instructor woman form. other saviour spiritual leader has ever given such honor womanhood the annals religious history. the mission bhagavan sri was show his living example how truly spiritual man, being dead the world senses, can live the spiritual plane god consciousness was prove that each individual soul immortal and potentially divine. his mission was establish harmony between religious sects and creeds. for the first time was absolutely demonstrated ramakrishna that all religions are like many paths leading the same goal, that the realization the same almighty being the highest ideal christianity, mahometanism, judaism, zoroastrianism, hinduism, well all other smaller religions the world. sri ramakrishna's mission was proclaim the eternal truth that god one but has many aspects, and that the same one worshipped different nations under various names and forms that personal, impersonal and beyond both that with name and form and yet nameless and formless. his mission was establish the worship the divine mother and thus elevate the ideal womanhood into divine motherhood. his mission was show his own example that true spirituality can transmitted and that salvation can obtained through the grace divine incarnation. his mission was declare before the world that psychic powers and the power healing are obstacles the path the attainment god consciousness. bhagavan sri ramakrishna possessed all the yoga powers but seldom exercised those powers, especially the power healing diseases. moreover, always prevented his disciples from either seeking exercising those powers. but one power which have seen him frequently exercise was the divine power transform the character sinner and lift worldly soul the plane superconsciousness single touch. would take the sins others upon his own shoulders and would purify them transmitting his own spirituality and opening the spiritual eyes his trite followers. the days prophecy have passed before our eyes. the manifestations the divine powers one who worshipped day thousands the latest incarnation divinity, have witnessed with our eyes. blessed are they who have seen him and touched his holy feet. may the glory sri ramakrishna felt all nations the earth may his divine power manifested the earnest and sincere souls his devotees all countries all ages come, the prayer his child and servant, abhedananda. footnotes chaitanya, the founder sect the vaishnavas, regarded india the incarnation krishna. also known the prophet nuddea, for nuddea bengal was his birthplace. his other name lord was born 1485 a.d., and was contemporary luther. vaishnava charan was great hindu

texts.com chapter sri ramakrishna the temple dakshineswara bhagavan sri ramakrishna lived for many years rani rashmoni's celebrated temple garden the eastern bank the ganges the village dakshineswara about four miles north calcutta. this temple with the garden attached was dedicated its foundress the divine mother the northwest corner the spacious temple compound small room which faces the west the waters the sacred river ganges. this room with its holy surroundings was consecrated the dwelling place for many years bhagavan sri ramakrishna, whose divine presence made the spot holier and more sacred. was from this retired corner that the rays his divine glory, emanating from his god intoxicated soul, dazzled the eyes the seekers after truth and attracted them him blazing fire attracts moths from all quarters. hundreds educated men and women were drawn towards this superhuman personality listen with the deepest reverence the words wisdom uttered one who had realized god and who lived constant communion with the divine mother the universe. one sunday the month march, 1882, mahendra, hearing from friend about this divine man, was deeply impressed that came the temple garden pay him respectful visit. was the day special religious festival and people had gathered great numbers sri ramakrishna's room and the veranda. the bhagavan was seated raised platform, and the floor around him were kedar, suresh, ram, manmohan, bijoy, and many other devotees. they gazed into his radiant face and drank the nectar the living words divine wisdom that fell from his hallowed lips. with smiling face sri ramakrishna was speaking them the power the lord's holy name and true bhakti the means attaining god vision. addressing bijoy, asked what you say the means attaining god? bijoy bhagavan, the repetition his holy name. this age the holy name the lord has saving powers. bhagavan yes, the holy name has saving powers, but there must earnest longing with it. without earnest longing the heart one can see god mere repetition his name. one may repeat his name, but one's mind attached lust and wealth, that will not help much. when man bitten scorpion tarantula, mere repetition mantram will not special remedy necessary. bijoy that the case, bhagavan, then how did ajamila, who was the greatest sinners and committed all sorts crimes, obtain salvation repeating the name the lord the time his death? ramakrishna perhaps his previous incarnations ajamila was righteous and performed great many good deeds. besides, said that practised asceticism later this life. may also said that the last moment his life the repetition the holy name purified his heart and therefore attained salvation. when elephant washed, immediately throws dust and dirt over himself but kept clean stall after his bath, then cannot cover himself with dirt. the power the holy name man may purified, but may once more commit sinful acts because his mind weak. cannot promise that will never sin again. the water the ganges may wash away past sins, but there saying that sins perch the top trees. when man comes out the ganges and stands under tree, the sins drop over his shoulders and seize upon him these old sins ride him, were. therefore, repeat the holy name the lord, but the same time pray him that you may have true love and devotion for him, and that your love for wealth, fame and the pleasures the body may decrease because they are transitory, they last only until morrow. when there true devotion and love, one can reach god any the sectarian religions. the vaishnavas, the worshippers krishna, will attain god the same way the saktas, the worshippers the divine mother the followers vedanta. those who belong the brahmo samaj, the mahometans and christians, will also realize god through their respective religions. you follow any these paths with intense devotion, you will reach him. there any mistake the path chosen, will correct the mistake the long run. the man who wishes see jagannath may towards the south instead towards the north, but some one will sooner later direct him the right way and will surely visit jagannath the end. the one thing necessary for realization whole hearted and whole souled devotion god. vaishnavas, mahometans, christians and hindus are all longing for the same god but they not know that who krishna also shiva, divine mother, christ and allah. god one, but has many names. the substance one, but worshipped under different names according the time, place and nationality his worshippers. all the different scriptures the world speak the same god. who described the vedas absolute existence intelligence bliss brahman, also described the tantras shiva, the puranas krishna, the koran allah, and the bible christ. yet the various sects quarrel with one another. the worshippers krishna, for instance, say that nothing can achieved without worshipping krishna those who are devoted the divine mother think that the worship the divine mother the only way salvation similarly, the christians say that one can reach heaven except through christ the only way and christianity the only religion, all other religions are false. this narrow mindedness. religion true while that others false, this kind belief not right. not our business correct the errors other religions. who has created the world will correct them time. our duty some way other realize him. god can reached through many paths each these sectarian religions points out path which ultimately leads divinity. yes all religions, are paths, but the paths are not god. have seen all sects and all paths. not care for them any more. people belonging these sects quarrel much! after trying all religions, have realized that god the whole and his part that the lord and his servant again realize, he. people dispute among themselves, saying god personal, with form. cannot impersonal and formless, like the vaishnavas who find fault with those who worship the impersonal brahman. when realization comes, then all these questions are settled. who has seen god can tell exactly what like. kavira said god with form mother, god without form father. whom shall blame, whom shall praise? the balance even. with form, yet formless. personal, yet impersonal, and who can say what other aspects may have! four blind men went see elephant. one touched leg the elephant and said the elephant like pillar. the second touched the trunk and said the elephant like thick club. the third touched the belly and said the elephant like huge jar. the fourth touched the ears and said the elephant like big winnowing basket. then they began dispute among themselves the figure the elephant. passer by, seeing them thus quarrelling, asked them what was about. they told him everything and begged him settle the dispute. the man replied none you has seen the elephant. the elephant not like pillar, its legs are like pillars. not like big water jar, its belly like water jar. not like winnowing basket, its ears are like winnowing baskets. not like stout club, its trunk like club. the elephant like the combination all these. the same manner those sectarians quarrel who have seen only one aspect the deity. alone who has seen god all his aspects can settle all disputes. again two persons were hotly disputing the color chameleon. one said the chameleon that palm tree red color. the other, contradicting him, replied you are mistaken, the chameleon not red but blue. not being able settle the matter argument, both went the person who always lived under that tree and had watched the chameleon all its phases color. one them asked him sir, not the chameleon that tree red? the person replied yes, sir. the other disputant said what you say? not red, blue. the person again humbly replied yes, sir. the person knew that the chameleon animal which constantly changes color thus was that said yes both these conflicting statements. the sat chit ananda likewise has many forms. the devotee who has seen god one aspect only, knows him that aspect alone. but who has seen him manifold aspects alone position say with authority all these forms are one god and god multiform. formless and with form, and many are his forms which one knows. god not only personal and with form but can take the form krishna, christ any other incarnation. true that manifests himself infinite forms fulfil the desires his devotees. also true that formless indivisible existence intelligence bliss absolute. the vedas have described him both personal, with form and attributes, and impersonal, beyond all form and attributes. you know how this is? like the infinite ocean absolute existence intelligence bliss. the ocean intense cold will freeze portion the water into ice which may float various forms the water, similarly intense devotion may condense portion divinity and make appear different forms. the personal god with form exists for the sake his bhaktas when the sun wisdom rises, the block ice melts and becomes water once more above, below, and every side the infinite being pervades. therefore there prayer the scriptures lord, thou art personal with form. thou art also impersonal and formless. thou hast manifested thyself human form and hast lived our midst, but the vedas thou art described beyond speech and mind, unspeakable, imperceptible and unthinkable. but can said that for certain class bhaktas eternally personal and always with form. there are places where the ice never melts, becomes crystallized. kedar bhagavan, also said the scriptures lord, thou art beyond speech and mind, but have described thy personal form only, thou forgive for this offense. bhagavan yes, god with form and also formless. one can say positively that much and more. devotee the lord appears personal being with form, but one who has attained the state selfless samadhi through the path discrimination and knowledge the formless, impersonal and absolute brahman. night had fallen and the priests were moving the lights before the shrines the accompaniment bells, cymbals, and drums. from the southern end the garden was wafted the sweet music played the temple musicians upon flutes and other instruments the music being carried far over the ganges until was lost. the breeze blowing from the south was gentle and fragrant with the sweet odor many flowers. the moon was rising and the garden was soon bathed its soft silvery light. seemed nature well man was rejoicing and holding herself readiness for the sacred ceremony the arati one one the disciples began take their leave. mahendra and his friend, who had been visiting the different temples, now wended their way back through the grand quadrangle sri ramakrishna's chamber. coming the door the room, they noticed that was closed. near the door stood maid servant named brinda. mahendra spoke her, saying well, good woman, the holy man in? brinda yes, his room. mahendra suppose has many books read and study? brinda dear not single one. everything, even the highest truths, spoken his tongue. his words are all inspired. mahendra indeed! now going through evening service? may in? will you kindly tell him our anxiety see him? brinda why, you may in, my. children. and take your seats before him. thereupon they entered the room. other people were there. bhagavan sri was alone, seated the afternoon the platform beside his bed. incense was burning and the doors were closed. mahendra saluted the bhagavan with folded hands. mat was pointed out the floor. his word mahendra and his friend took their seats upon it. the bhagavan asked him what your name? where you live? what are you? what has brought you barahanagore? mahendra answered each these questions, but noticed that the course the conversation sri ramakrishna's mind was fixed upon some other object, which was meditating. was only half conscious the physical plane and his attitude resembled that man quietly seated rod hand, intent catching fish. when the float trembles and the fish bites, the man eagerly looks the float, grasping the rod with all his strength. does not talk anyone, but his whole mind fixed upon the float. such was the bhagavan's concentration this moment. mahendra learned afterwards that this was the state samadhi god consciousness which invariably came over him every day during the evening service. very often this state would become absolutely unconscious the external world. mahendra, observing his abstraction, said sri ramakrishna afraid, bhagavan, that thou wouldst prefer through the evening service alone. that case will not disturb thee any more, but will call some other time. sri ramakrishna replied no, you need not hurry. but was silent again for time. then opened his lips and said sandhya? evening service? not that. short while after, mahendra saluted the bhagavan, who turn bade him good bye, saying, come again. footnotes bhagavan sanskrit word meaning the blessed lord. when the word used

events which are now translated and embodied the present volume. barahanagore suburb calcutta. the gospel ramakrishna, ed. swami abhedananda, sacred texts.com chapter sri ramakrishna with his disciples the temple the bhagavan was his room seated his usual place the small platform beside his bed. was sunday and the room was filled with large number devotees. among them was young college student only nineteen years age named narendra, who afterwards became the world renowned swami vivekananda. everyone noticed even that time that was sincere and earnest seeker after truth and that his mind was above all worldly concerns. his eyes were shining with spiritual light, his face was aglow with innocence and simplicity, and his words were full spiritual power. the bhagavan was discoursing worldly people who ridicule the worshippers god. especially addressing narendra, asked what you say, narendra? worldly men will speak all manner things against godly people, but they should act like the elephant. when elephant passes through public road, dogs run after him and bark him but the elephant turns deaf ear their barking and goes his own way. suppose, boy, people should speak ill you behind your back, what would you think them? narendra would look upon them lot barking dogs. the bhagavan laughed and said no, friend, not far that. you should love everyone one stranger god dwells all beings without him nothing can exist. when prahlada realized him, the lord asked him crave boon. prahlada replied when have seen thee, what other boon need? the lord asked him again. then prayed thou wishest grant boon, thou forgive those who have persecuted me. prahlada meant that persecuting him they had persecuted the lord dwelling within him. know that god resides all things animate and inanimate. hence everything object worship, men, beasts birds, plants minerals our relation with men all that can take heed ourselves that mix with good people and avoid bad company. true, however, that god resides bad people also, yes, even tiger but surely does not follow that should embrace tiger. may asked why should run away from tiger when god dwelling that form? this the answer that god abiding our hearts directs run away from the tiger. why should not obey his will? certain forest there lived sage who had number disciples. taught his disciples the truth god dwells all things. knowing this, you should bend your knee before every object. one day disciple went out into the forest for wood. his way saw man riding mad elephant and shouting get out the way, get out the way! this mad elephant. the disciple, instead running away, remembered his master's teaching and began reason god the elephant well me. god cannot hurt god, why should run away? thus thinking, stood where was and saluted the elephant came nearer. the driver kept shouting get out the way! but the disciple would not move, until was snatched the mad elephant and dashed one side. the poor boy, bruised and bleeding, lay the ground unconscious. the sage, hearing the accident, came with his other disciples carry him home. when after some time the unfortunate pupil recovered consciousness, described what had happened. the sage replied boy, true that god manifest everything. but the elephant, not equally manifest the driver tell why you did not pay heed the warning the driver? the bhagavan continued the sacred scriptures written, god dwells water but some water can used for divine service, for drinking purposes, some for bathing washing, while dirty water cannot touched even. the same manner, although god resides all human beings, still there are good men and bad men, there are lovers god and those who not love god. should recognize divinity all, but should not mix with bad people with those who not love god. our relation with them must not very close. wise avoid the company such people. narendra what attitude should hold when wicked people come disturb our peace actually offend us? bhagavan person living society should have little tamas resistance for purposes self protection. but evil this necessary only for outward show, its object being prevent the wicked from doing harm you. the same time you should not actual injury another the ground that has done injury you. there was large venomous snake field. one dared that way. one day holy man passed that road and the serpent ran after the sage bite him. but when the snake approached the holy man, lost all his ferocity and was overpowered the gentleness the yogi. seeing him, the sage said well, friend, think you bite me? the snake was abashed and made reply. this the sage continued hearken, friend not injure anyone future. the snake bowed and nodded assent. the sage went his way, and the snake entered his hole and thenceforward began live life innocence, without attempting harm anyone. few days all the neighborhood concluded that the snake had lost his venom and was longer dangerous everyone began tease him. they pelted him with stones dragged him mercilessly the tail, and there was end his troubles. fortunately the sage again passed that way, and seeing the bruised and battered condition the snake, was very much moved and inquired the cause. holy sir, the snake replied, this because not injure anyone after your advice. but alas! they are merciless! the sage smilingly said friend, simply advised you not bite anyone but did not tell you not frighten others. although you should not bite any living creature, still you should keep people distance hissing them. and sri ramakrishna added there harm hissing wicked men and your enemies, showing that you can protect yourself and know how resist evil. only you must careful not pour your venom into the blood your enemy. resist not evil causing evil return. one the devotees present said but when person annoyed with me, bhagavan, feel unhappy. feel that have not been able love everyone equally. ramakrishna when you feel that way, you should have talk with that person and try make peace with him. you fail after such attempts, then you need not give further thought. take refuge with the lord. think upon him. not let your mind disturbed any other thing. devotee christ and chaitanya have both taught love all mankind. ramakrishna you should love everyone because god dwells all beings. but wicked people you should bow down distance. true that people blame you because you mix with those who believe personal god with form? true devotee god should possess absolute calmness and never disturbed the opinions others. like blacksmith's anvil, will endure all blows and persecutions. and yet remain firm his faith and always the same. wicked people may say many things about you and blame you but you long for god, you should endure with patience. one can think god even dwelling the midst wicked people. the sages ancient times, who lived forests, could meditate god although surrounded tigers, hears, and other wild beasts. the nature the wicked like that tiger bear. they attack the innocent and injure them. you should especially cautious coming contact with the following first, the wealthy. person who possesses wealth and many attendants can easily harm another desires. you should very guarded speaking with him sometimes may even necessary agree with him his opinion. second, dog. when dog barks you, you must not run, but talk him and quiet him. third bull. when bull chases you, you should always pacify him talking him. fourth drunkard. you make him angry, will call you names and swear you. you should address him dear relative, then will happy and obliging. when wicked people come see me, very careful. the character some them like that snake. they may bite you unawares. may take long time and much discrimination recover from the effects that bite. you may get angry them that you will wish take revenge. necessary, however, keep occasionally the company holy men. through such association right discrimination will come. there are four classes jivas, individual souls first, baddha, the bound second, mumukshu, the seeker after freedom third, mukta, the emancipated and fourth, nitya mukta, the eternally free. this world like net, the soul the fish, and the lord the phenomenal world the fisherman. when fisherman draws his net, some the fish try escape rending the net, that is, they struggle for freedom. are the souls the second class, the mumukshus, the seekers after freedom. but among the fish that struggle, only few escape. similarly, few souls only attain freedom and they belong the third class, the muktas. there are some fish, however, that are naturally cautious and never fall into the net. such are the souls the fourth class, the nitya muktas, who are never caught the net the phenomenal world, but who remain eternally free, like narada and others like him. most the fish, however, fall into the net and have not the sense know that they are going die there. when caught, they try run away and hide the mud the bottom swimming with the net. they make effort get out the net, but deeper and deeper into the mud. these may compared the souls who are bound fast the world. they are caught the net, but they delude themselves thinking that they are happy. they remain attached worldliness. they plunge into the mire worldly evils and are content, while those who are seeking after freedom who are emancipated not like worldliness and not care for sense pleasures. those who are thus caught the net the world are the baddha, bound souls. one can awaken them. they not come their senses even after receiving blow upon blow misery, sorrow and indescribable suffering. the camel loves thorny bushes, and although his mouth bleeds when eats them, still does not cease love them dearly and one can keep him away from them. the bound souls may meet with great grief and misfortune, but after few days they are just they were before. the wife may die become unchaste, the man will marry again his son may die, will extremely sorrowful, but will soon forget him. the mother the boy may overwhelmed with grief for short time, but few days she will once more concerned for her personal appearance and will deck herself with jewels and finery. such worldly people may left paupers after marrying their sons and daughters, yet they will still beget children every year. they may lose their fortune lawsuit, but they will again the courts. they may not able support their children, educate, feed, clothe, house them properly, still they will continue have more. they are like the snake with musk rat its mouth. the snake cannot swallow the rat because its strong odor, neither can throw out because its own bent teeth, these bound souls, baddhas, although they may occasionally feel that the world unreal, can neither give nor can they fix their minds the reality the universe. once saw relative keshab chunder sen, who was quite old, still playing cards the time for meditating god had not come for him. there another sign baddha, worldly soul. you remove him from the world and put him better place, will pine away and die. will work like slave support his family, and will not hesitate tell lies, deceive flatter order earn his livelihood. looks upon those who worship god who meditate the lord the universe insane. never finds time opportunity think spiritual subjects. even the hour death will think and talk worldly things. whatever thought strongest the minds worldly people comes out the time death. they become delirious, they rave nothing but material objects. they may places worship, but long their minds are attached the world, worldly thoughts will rise the last moment. parrot may taught utter the lord's holy name, but when attacked cat, screams and gives its natural cry they may repeat the holy name the lord, but when attacked death, the natural tendency their minds will predominate. said the bhagavad gita that the future determined the thought that uppermost the moment death, and the purana there story that king bharata was born deer because when died, his mind was fixed the thought deer. who passes away thinking god and meditating him, does not come back this world.
